Aerobic helps you track your weekly minutes of training in zone 2. Zone 2 training is the most effective way of building your cardiovascular capacity for performance and health. This kind of training consists of exercising at an easy intensity for a relatively long time.
</p>
<p>
To train in zone 2, you need to exercise at an easy, yet consistent, pace. The best way to determine how fast you should go is the &quot;talk test&quot;. This means, you should be able to maintain a conversation and speak in full sentences. Though, it shouldn&#39;t be very comfortable.

<p>
Once you have a few workouts of this kind under your belt, you&#39;ll be able to determine the heart-rate range in which you tend to be while performing these workouts. Aerobic uses a heart-rate range to compute your weekly minutes of zone 2 training. For best results, use you own observed heart-rate range to customize Aerobic&#39;s algorithms from the settings panel.
